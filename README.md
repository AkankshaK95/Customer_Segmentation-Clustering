# Customer_Segmentation-Clustering
Customer segmentation is a powerful technique used by businesses to categorize their customers into distinct groups based on similarities in behavior, demographics, or purchasing patterns. One of the most effective ways to achieve this is through clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique that identifies natural groupings within data.

Project Overview
This project involves two key files:
1️⃣ Mall_Customer.csv – A dataset containing customer attributes such as age, income, and spending score.
2️⃣ Customer_Segmentation.ipynb – A Jupyter Notebook implementing clustering techniques to segment customers.

The project not only focuses on identifying customer cohorts but also includes business strategies to effectively target different clusters.

Business Application
By segmenting customers, businesses can:
✅ Personalize marketing campaigns
✅ Improve customer retention strategies
✅ Enhance product recommendations
✅ Optimize pricing models
